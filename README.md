This is my submission for [VRt Contest 2019](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/66761) (organized by VeeRoute). As an employee of VeeRoute, I couldn't participate in the contest publicly, meaning you won't see my submission in the results table. I did, however, participate in internal contest which was conducted under exactly same conditions as public one (same tests, same dates, etc.), but was limited to VeeRoute employees only.

**Full disclosure**: I had technical possibility to cheat by looking at other participants' solutions, however, I did not do that.

**Problem statement**: https://codeforces.com/contest/1160/problem/A2 .

## Result

My score on final tests is **616658** which is within 4% of the score of â„–1 participant. This would place me in 4th place if I did participate in public contest.
